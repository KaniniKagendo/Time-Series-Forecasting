# Algorithmic Momentum Trading Strategy

Welcome to the Algorithmic Momentum Trading Strategy project! Here, we delve into the exciting world of algorithmic trading, where cutting-edge algorithms analyze financial data to provide optimized insights, enabling traders to maximize portfolio returns.

**Introduction**

Algorithmic trading revolutionizes the way investors navigate the financial markets. By automating trading decisions based on predefined rules, it offers efficiency and precision far beyond manual trading methods. In this project, we focus on creating an algorithmic trading strategy tailored for Tesla stock, leveraging advanced techniques to identify buying and selling signals with clarity and accuracy.

**Objectives**

Our primary goal is to develop a robust trading strategy that capitalizes on short-term uptrends in Tesla's stock price, while promptly exiting positions as momentum begins to wane. Specifically, we aim to achieve the following objectives:

- Describe the trend of Tesla's stock price data based on volatility.
- Identify buying opportunities during short-term uptrends.
- Implement an efficient mechanism to sell when momentum declines.
- Enhance stock price direction prediction for informed decision-making.
  
**Methodology**

1. Feature Selection and Model Training
   
We employ the random forest variable importance technique to identify relevant indicators, including Relative Strength Index, Commodity Channel Index, Momentum, William's %R, Ultimate Oscillator, and Rate of Change. These indicators are standardized and fed into various models for training.

2. Classification of Trading Decisions
   
Using the trained models, our system classifies stock trading decisions into two classes: buy and sell. We establish clear trading rules based on predicted market trends:

- If the next day trend is uptrend, the decision is to buy.
- If a buy decision already exists, hold.
- If the next day trend is downtrend, the decision is to sell.
- If a sell decision already exists, hold.

3. Implementation of Momentum Strategy
   
Additionally, we implement a momentum trading strategy on Tesla's stock price data using Python. This strategy dictates buying stocks when momentum is positive and selling when momentum turns negative, further enhancing trading efficiency.

**About the Data**

We sourced Tesla's daily historical data from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from January 1, 2017, to January 31, 2023. The dataset includes variables such as date, opening price, highest and lowest prices of the day, closing price, adjusted close price, and traded volume. We split the data into 80% training set and 20% test set to facilitate model development and evaluation.
